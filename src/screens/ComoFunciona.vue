                A blockchain is really long 'chain' of data 'blocks' that are publicly available for everyone to see. Every transaction, every fee, every recipient etc... 
                can be viewed by anyone. The privacy comes from how no one knows who owns which cryto 'address' or 'wallet'. This means you can send money anywhere in the world,
                and all of its future movements can be tracked by you.
